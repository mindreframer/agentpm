## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase XA, XC, or XE)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase XB, XD, or XF) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Epic 5 Specific Considerations

- **Event Querying:** Advanced filtering with performance optimization
- **Atomic Operations:** Safe test/event updates with rollback capability

### Performance Targets
- **Test Operations:** < 50ms for test status updates
- **Event Logging:** < 25ms for event creation and storage
- **Event Queries:** < 100ms for complex timeline generation
- **File Parsing:** < 10ms for file change specification parsing

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Catch issues as soon as code is written  
✅ **Working Code** - Each phase delivers tested, working functionality  
✅ **Epic 5 Coverage** - All Epic 5 test scenarios distributed across phases  
✅ **Incremental Progress** - Test/event commands work after each phase  
✅ **Risk Mitigation** - Problems caught early, not at the end  
✅ **Quality Assurance** - No untested code makes it to later phases  

## Test Distribution Summary

- **Phase 1 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Test management, status transitions)
- **Phase 2 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Event system, file change tracking)
- **Phase 3 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Event logging, integration, context)
- **Phase 4 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Event querying, blocker detection)
- **Phase 5 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Command implementation, validation)
- **Phase 6 Tests:** 9 scenarios (Integration, performance, production readiness)
