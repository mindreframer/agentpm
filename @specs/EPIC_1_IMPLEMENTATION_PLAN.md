## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase XA or XC)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase XB or XD) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Epic 1 Specific Considerations

### Dependencies & Requirements
- **Go 1.21+** - Required for language features and module support
- **CLI Framework:** `github.com/urfave/cli/v3` for command structure
- **XML Processing:** `github.com/beevik/etree` with XPath support
- **Testing:** `github.com/stretchr/testify` for assertions
- **Snapshot Testing:** `github.com/gkampitakis/go-snaps` for complex outputs

### Technical Architecture
- **Dependency Injection:** Storage abstraction for testability
- **Error Handling:** Structured errors with context and suggestions
- **Configuration:** JSON format with validation and defaults
- **XML Output:** Consistent structured output for all commands
- **Testing:** Isolated tests with `t.TempDir()` for file operations

### Performance Targets
- **CLI Startup:** < 50ms cold start time
- **Configuration Loading:** < 10ms for typical configuration files
- **Epic Validation:** < 100ms for complex epic files with full validation
- **Help Display:** < 20ms for any help command execution

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Catch issues as soon as code is written  
✅ **Working Code** - Each phase delivers tested, working functionality  
✅ **Epic 1 Coverage** - All Epic 1 test scenarios distributed across phases  
✅ **Incremental Progress** - CLI commands work after each phase  
✅ **Risk Mitigation** - Problems caught early, not at the end  
✅ **Quality Assurance** - No untested code makes it to later phases  

## Test Distribution Summary

- **Phase 1 Tests:** 6 scenarios (CLI framework, storage abstraction)
- **Phase 2 Tests:** 10 scenarios (Configuration management, init/config commands)
- **Phase 3 Tests:** 8 scenarios (Epic parsing, loading, file operations)
- **Phase 4 Tests:** 10 scenarios (Validation engine, validate command)
- **Phase 5 Tests:** 10 scenarios (Test infrastructure, integration testing)

**Total: All Epic 1 test scenarios covered across all phases**
