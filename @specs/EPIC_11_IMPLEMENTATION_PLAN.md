2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase 11B or 11D) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests (60%):** Context retrieval, progress calculations, output formatting
- **Integration Tests (30%):** CLI integration, command enhancement, data flow
- **Performance Tests (10%):** Context retrieval speed, memory usage, large file handling

### Test Isolation
- Each test uses `t.TempDir()` for filesystem isolation
- Mock epic files with controlled hierarchical structures
- Context engine tests use in-memory data structures
- Performance tests use standardized datasets

### Test Data Management
- Sample epic files with realistic multi-level structures
- Context test cases covering all entity relationship patterns
- Edge case test data for comprehensive validation coverage
- Performance benchmarks with measurable context complexity
- Various epic states and completion levels
- Large epic files with deep hierarchies for stress testing
