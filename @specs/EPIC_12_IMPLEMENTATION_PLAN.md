## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase 12A or 12C)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase 12B or 12D) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Epic 12 Specific Considerations

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests (70%):** Event creation, data formatting, service integration
- **Integration Tests (25%):** Timeline integration, command interaction, data flow
- **Performance Tests (5%):** Event creation overhead, timeline performance

### Test Isolation
- Each test uses `t.TempDir()` for filesystem isolation
- Mock epic files with controlled event scenarios
- Event service tests use in-memory data structures
- Performance tests use standardized operation loads

### Test Data Management
- Sample epic files with various operation states
- Event test cases covering all new event types
- Edge case scenarios for comprehensive coverage
- Performance benchmarks with measurable event loads
- Mixed operation sequences for timeline testing
- Large epic files for stress testing event creation

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Complete Coverage** - All XML modifications will have proper event logging  
✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Event creation issues caught during development  
✅ **Working Functionality** - Each phase delivers tested event capabilities  
✅ **Performance Validated** - Event creation overhead verified under 5ms
