## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase XA, XC, or XE)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase XB, XD, or XF) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Epic 3 Specific Considerations

### Dependencies & Integration
- **Epic 1:** CLI framework, configuration management, epic loading, validation, storage abstraction
- **Epic 2:** Status analysis for completion validation, pending work discovery, current state analysis
- **State Machine:** Controlled transitions with comprehensive validation
- **Event System:** Comprehensive audit trail for all lifecycle changes

### Technical Requirements
- **Atomic Operations:** File updates with rollback capability to prevent corruption
- **Event Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail with timestamps and metadata
- **State Validation:** Enforce valid transitions with precondition checking
- **Completion Validation:** Integration with Epic 2 for work completion verification
- **Configuration Updates:** Safe project switching with validation

### State Machine Implementation
- **Transition Matrix:** Enforce valid status transitions with clear rules
- **Preconditions:** Validate epic state before allowing transitions
- **Event Generation:** Create detailed events for all lifecycle changes
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error reporting for invalid operations
- **Rollback:** Atomic operations with failure recovery

### Performance Targets
- **Lifecycle Operations:** < 100ms for start/pause/resume commands
- **Completion Validation:** < 200ms for complex epics with many tasks/tests
- **File Operations:** < 50ms for atomic file updates
- **Configuration Updates:** < 50ms for project switching operations

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Catch issues as soon as code is written  
✅ **Working Code** - Each phase delivers tested, working functionality  
✅ **Epic 3 Coverage** - All Epic 3 test scenarios distributed across phases  
✅ **Incremental Progress** - Lifecycle commands work after each phase  
✅ **Risk Mitigation** - Problems caught early, not at the end  
✅ **Quality Assurance** - No untested code makes it to later phases  

## Test Distribution Summary

- **Phase 1 Tests:** 7 scenarios (State machine, atomic operations)
- **Phase 2 Tests:** 5 scenarios (Event logging, event integration)
- **Phase 3 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Epic start, completion validation)
- **Phase 4 Tests:** 5 scenarios (Pause/resume operations, duration calculation)
- **Phase 5 Tests:** 10 scenarios (Project switching, validation, integration)

**Total: All Epic 3 test scenarios covered across all phases**
