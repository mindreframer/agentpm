3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

✅ **Working Code** - Each phase delivers tested, working functionality  
✅ **Epic 6 Coverage** - All Epic 6 test scenarios distributed across phases  
✅ **Incremental Progress** - Handoff/docs commands work after each phase  
✅ **Risk Mitigation** - Problems caught early, not at the end  
✅ **Quality Assurance** - No untested code makes it to later phases  

## Test Distribution Summary

- **Phase 1 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Handoff data aggregation, recent activity)
- **Phase 2 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Blocker detection, next action generation)
- **Phase 3 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Documentation framework, content generation)
- **Phase 4 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Context analysis, work pattern analysis)
- **Phase 5 Tests:** 6 scenarios (Command implementation, validation)
