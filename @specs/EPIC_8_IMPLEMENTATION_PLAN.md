## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase XA or XC)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase XB or XD) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Epic 8 Specific Considerations

### Dependencies & Integration
- **Epic 1:** CLI framework, configuration management, existing command patterns
- **Epic 2:** Query service patterns for consistent output formatting
- **Build System:** VERSION file, Git repository, Go toolchain
- **Testing:** Build artifact verification, cross-platform compatibility

### Technical Requirements
- **Build-time Injection:** Use Go ldflags for embedding version information
- **Cross-platform:** Support Linux, macOS, Windows build targets
- **Format Consistency:** JSON/XML output follows existing command patterns
- **CI/CD Friendly:** Build process works in automated environments
- **Version Validation:** Proper handling of semantic versions and edge cases

### Priority Implementation Order
1. **Version Command** - Core functionality for displaying version information
2. **Makefile & Build System** - Essential developer experience improvements
3. **Build-time Injection** - Professional-grade version management
4. **Cross-platform Support** - Broader deployment compatibility
