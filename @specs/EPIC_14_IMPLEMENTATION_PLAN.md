## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase 14A or 14C)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase 14B or 14D) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests (60%):** Builder pattern, assertion methods, command integration
- **Integration Tests (30%):** Memory storage, service integration, snapshot testing
- **Performance Tests (10%):** Execution speed, memory usage, concurrent execution

### Test Isolation
- Each test uses isolated memory storage instances
- Builder state is independent across test cases
- Command service calls don't affect global state
- Snapshot tests use dedicated test data directories

### Test Data Management
- Realistic epic structures with multiple phases, tasks, and tests
- Transition scenarios covering all command types
- Error cases for comprehensive validation coverage
- Performance benchmarks with measurable targets
- Complex workflow patterns for integration testing

✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Builder and transition issues caught during development  
✅ **Working Functionality** - Each phase delivers tested framework capabilities  
✅ **Epic 14 Coverage** - All acceptance criteria covered across phases  
✅ **Performance Validated** - Speed and memory requirements verified early
