I want to brainstorm the roadmap for a new PM tool for LLM agents. It must be implemented in Golang. 
The data for a single EPIC will be stored in an XML file. 

Idea: 
- no concurrency, only a single agent works on a single epic file (at least locally)
- prefer simlicity over rich features
- the CLI is the primary way to interact with this tool
- it must be non-interactive, so it is simple to use for the agent
- it must provide a good help system with good examples, so agents can discover what can be done with the tool 
- I want to use https://github.com/beevik/etree for the XML parsing / writing / querying (xpath-like support!)
- performance is not an issue, since we have a small local file, and not gigabytes of data, so prefer simplicity over performance (important!)

### Dependencies & Requirements
- **Go 1.21+** - Required for language features and performance
- **CLI Framework:** `github.com/urfave/cli/v3` - Mature, agent-friendly CLI library
- **XML Processing:** `github.com/beevik/etree` - Fast, reliable XML parsing
- **Testing Framework:** `github.com/stretchr/testify` - Comprehensive assertions
- **Snapshot Testing:** `github.com/gkampitakis/go-snaps` - For output validation
