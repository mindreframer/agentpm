## Development Workflow Per Phase

For **EACH** phase:

1. **Implement Code** (Phase XA, XC, or XE)
2. **Write Tests IMMEDIATELY** (Phase XB, XD, or XF) 
3. **Run Tests & Verify** - All tests must pass
4. **Run Linting/Type Checking** - Code must be clean
5. **NEVER move to next phase with failing tests**

## Epic 4 Specific Considerations

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Catch issues as soon as code is written  
✅ **Working Code** - Each phase delivers tested, working functionality  
✅ **Epic 4 Coverage** - All Epic 4 test scenarios distributed across phases  
✅ **Incremental Progress** - Phase/task commands work after each phase  
✅ **Risk Mitigation** - Problems caught early, not at the end  
✅ **Quality Assurance** - No untested code makes it to later phases  

## Test Distribution Summary

- **Phase 1 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Phase dependencies, cycle detection)
- **Phase 2 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Task management, phase context)
- **Phase 3 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Auto-next selection, phase progression)
- **Phase 4 Tests:** 7 scenarios (Progress calculation, current state)
- **Phase 5 Tests:** 5 scenarios (Command implementation, XML output)
